<p class="contentp">"A summer of service for a lifetime of ministry" This is what we call a Royal Servants missions trip because what we do is about more than just our month of overseas serving. It is about training and equipping students to be actively engaged in the discipleship process. "What does a disciple look like?" you may ask. Well, ask any of the students and they will tell you (with gusto) that the profile of a disciple is:</p>

<ul  class="contentp">
  <li>A passion for God</li>
  <li>A compassion for the lost</li>
  <li>A love for the brethren, and</li>
  <li>A personal driving vision</li>
</ul>

<p class="contentp">Imagine what could happen when 19 young people come back to their homes and schools having been fully equipped not only to be like this themselves, but to pass on this same vision to the people around them. This summer I am a part of the Senior Staff team, which means that my ministry this summer is to the students and staff - facilitating this process of personal and spiritual growth.</p>

<p class="contentp">Being on the leadership team of a missions trip is vastly different from any experience I've had or anything I was expecting. My main job this summer is managing the team's money, which involves balancing the books, tracking all expenses, planning ahead for all future expenses, and carrying far more money than is comfortable. My job doesn't stop there, however. I am also doing lots of teaching, supervising, planning and especially serving. Most nights are late and most mornings are early. It is way more work than I anticipated, but I am loving every minute of it!</p>
