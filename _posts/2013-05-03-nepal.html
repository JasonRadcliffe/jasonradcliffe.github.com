<p class="contentp">I have personally seen a Goddess. Deity in human flesh. You might be surprised to find out that
 this concept is present in the Hindu faith in the form of the Kumari goddess who lives in Kathmandu, Nepal.
 Every few years a new girl is chosen who is believed to be the next one the goddess will inhabit. She will hardly
 ever leave the temple, she is only allowed to speak to a very limited number of people, and her feet never
 touch the ground. On my last visit, I had the chance to go into this temple and see her, which is not an experience 
 I will forget any time soon. Ever since, the Christian claim that Jesus was God incarnate takes on some special
 significance for me, mainly because I am acutely aware of the differences between the God I know, and the one
 who lives in the second floor of a temple in Durbar Square: </p>
 
 <p class="contentpindent">Jesus made it a point to associate with the lowest of the low in his society,
 being present and engaged with them. Kumari does not speak, and will only appear and wave to those who enter her temple.</p>
 
 <p class="contentpindent">Jesus got down on his hands and knees to wash the feet of his disciples while the
 Kumari cannot even touch the ground while heads of state come to bow and touch her feet.</p>
 
 <p class="contentpindent">The Kumari goddess loses her deity if any blood leaves her body for any reason,
 while Jesus came for the express purpose of shedding his blood on a cross to take the penalty for our sins.</p>
 
 <p class="contentp">Many people, including most of the inhabitants of Nepal will try to tell you that Christianity
 and Hinduism are just different paths to God. I see differences like this and I canâ€™t help but disagree.</p>
