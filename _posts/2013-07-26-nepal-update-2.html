title: Nepal Update #2

<p class="contentp">I have been learning a lot this summer about how sometimes there is a difference between ministry that sounds impressive and ministry that will actually make the biggest impact in building the Kingdom of God. Two examples of this come to mind:</p>

<p class="contentp">The first came on the day when we were scheduled to take the team to the leper colony. Leprosy is treatable today, however in the more remote areas of Nepal, when people get the disease, they will end up losing much of their hands, feet and even parts of their faces, leaving them disfigured and disabled. They are then shipped off to a commune where they get a roof over their heads and not much else from the government. It is always really cool to be able to go there and share the love of God with people who are unaccustomed to receiving love from anyone at all. Anyway, I didn't get to go to the leper colony. I was sitting in my room with a calculator adding up receipts and counting money all day instead. One of those things sounded really cool, and the other one was what God had called me to Nepal for - the work that was necessary.</p>

<p class="contentp">The other example comes from when the team got to meet with an organization that helps fight sex trafficking in Nepal. We met with an American staff member to find out how it all works and how people can get involved with the organization.</p>

<p class="contentp">We expected to hear stories about daring rescue missions and freeing girls being transported in the back of trucks and the border stations. Instead what we found out, is that westerners get to be involved as support staff. The border stations are run by Nepali volunteers because they blend in and they know what to look for in terms of being able to discern where travelers are coming from ethnically. They are the ones working with the Nepali government because it is opposed to American involvement. Nepali people are the ones who can be house parents for the orphanages they run. The list goes on and on, but the point is that doing behind the scenes, "boring" work is sometimes exactly what is needed if we are to be involved in the highest and best plans God has for us.</p>
