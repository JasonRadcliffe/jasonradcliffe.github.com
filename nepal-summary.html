<p class="contentp">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This summer I have a chance to go to Nepal on a missions trip! As you may or may not know,
I went to Nepal in 2011 as a small group leader with an organization called Reign Ministries. This was a 7 week trip for Jr. High and High School age students
 with a focus on relational evangelism and discipleship (of the students too!). The team was comprised of 20 students, 6 small group leaders, and 4 Senior
 staff members, including the team leaders Job and Bethany Hammond. We were overseas in Nepal for just over a month, taking day trips into villages
 to share the gospel, while trying to build slightly longer term relationships in the two cities where we were stayed.</p>


<p class="contentp">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, it was an incredible experience, which is why I said yes when Job and Bethany asked if I wanted to go back with them this
summer as senior staff. Historically, Reign Ministries missions trips have one staff member to handle medical things, one for food, and another for money. This
year’s Nepal team will be different, and so I will not fit exactly into one of those roles. My specific job is a little up in the air, but some of my responsibilities
will include making sure the team’s equipment goes where it needs to, and being the official escort for the team since I am the only adult male other than team leader
Job. We may be doing some soccer ministry in the villages we go to, so I would probably do that as well. As you can imagine, leading a team of 30 plus students in
Nepal is not easy, logistically speaking, and so I am excited to serve in this capacity to facilitate the amazing ministry that will go on this summer.</p>


<p class="contentp">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to help, there are two things I need:</p>
<p class="contentp">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Finances</b>. I need to raise $4,690 by May 15. This seems like a large sum, but I have
the support of some very faithful friends and a very faithful God. If you would like to help out financially, a gift of around $100 would be incredibly
helpful. Keep in mind that you are not just investing in me, you are also investing in the students going on the trip and in the people we come into
contact with in Nepal. If you want to give, you can make a check out to 'Reign Ministries' and mail it

 or you could <a href="http://reignministries.org/sponsor-rs" onClick="(alert('Please be sure to select my name from the drop down menu'))">give online</a>.</p>

<p class="contentp">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <b>Prayer</b>.  <em>The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.</em> &nbsp&nbsp~&nbsp&nbsp James 5:16. Pray that:
<ul class="contentlist"> <li>I will be able to raise the funds I need </li>
<li>God will be preparing me and the rest of the team for an intense summer of ministry   </li>
<li>God’s Spirit will be working even now in the hearts of the Nepali people we will be meeting  </li>
